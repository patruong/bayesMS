    "[Triqler](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30482846/) is a novel software for protein quantification and differential protein identification. It uses probabilistic graphical models to generate posterior distributions for fold changes between treatment groups, highlighting uncertainty rather than hiding it. Conventional (frequentist) methods use filters and imputations to control error rate and often ignore certain error sources. This project aims to benchmark Triqler against MaxQuant (A commonly used tool for protein quantification). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, a data set with 10 samples containing mixtures of Arabidopsis Thaliana, Caenorhabditis Elegans and Homo Sapiens proteins are used. The concentration levels are known. Theoretically, the results from Triqler should be more representative of the de facto protein quantification, since no filters or imputations methods are used, but previous attempts at showing this fact ([here](https://patruong.github.io/bayesProtQuant/)) have shown that imputation methods could severely impact the results obtained by MaxQuant, making it look either much worse or much better by giving it an unfair advantage or disadvantage. One important aspect of this research is therefore how to make a fair comparison of Triqler and MaxQuant. Sub-tasks to answer relating to this aspect is \"How do we make a fair imputation if we need to impute values?\" and \"How do we visualize the comparison in a meaningful and comprehensible way?\"."

    "## Problem\n",
    "Triqler is a novel software that uses bayesian model for protein quantification. The use of bayesian modeling for protein quantification has not yet been shown better than existing methods, but the fact that Triqler is handling errors in multiple steps in a more theoretical sound way than the most commonly used protein quantification pipelines gives indication that it is better. A benchmark of said Triqler is therefore needed to show its performance. \n",

    "### Protein quantification using mass spectrometry\n",
    "Label-free mass spectrometry (MS) is an increasingly important tool for researchers in life sciences ([Zhu et al. 2009](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2010/840518/)). In the last decade developments in MS methodologies has made it possible to use it for accurate protein quantification ([Ong et al. 2005](https://www.nature.com/articles/nchembio736)). Various softwares has been developed for processing raw MS data into quantified protein abundances ([Mueller et al. 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18173218/)). Each of which has a unique set of algorithms for different tasks of the MS data processing workflow. A systematic review of the various softwares has been conducted by [Välikangas et al. 2017](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/19/6/1344/3859191). \n",

    "### Missing values and Bayesian missing data. \n",
    "Missing values are a frequent problem in life science studies. Incomplete data can cause substantial amount of bias and seriously compromise inferences from studies if they are not hendled appropriately ([Jakobsen et al. 2017](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-017-0442-1)). Besides the common missing value imputation methods (such as min, max, mean and median imputation. So called single imputation which cause bias ([Dziura et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24058309/))) various methods have been developed to tackle this problem, such as using imputation models ([Barnard et al. 1999](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/096228029900800103)) and multiple imputation methods ([Jørgensen et al. 2014](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111964)). The mechanism causing the data to be missing is another aspect that should be considered when handling missing values if possible ([Jakobsen et al. 2017](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-017-0442-1#ref-CR19)). Bayesian methods have been receiving much attention in the literature for handling missing values in various context, and with or without taking different mechnisms into account ([Ma et al. 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324510645_Bayesian_methods_for_dealing_with_missing_data_problems#pfe)). Using Bayesian models the missingness can be modelled using observed quantities by using known data to marginalize. Therefore, handling missing values with Bayesian models are very natural and comes without imputing, such as used in [The et al. 2018](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/357285v2). However, incorrectly specied missing values also does cause problems for Bayesian models ([Mason J. 2010](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/5498)) and corretly specifying missing models greatly improves the overall model fit ([Mason et al. 2010](http://eprints.ncrm.ac.uk/1691/1/InsightsSubmitted.pdf)). In [The et al. 2018](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/357285v2) a probability distribution is assined over the possible values of the missing value, and this distribution is marginalized over when inferrening protein's quantity. Resulting in a protein quantity which incorporates uncertainty into it, which is manifested by a larger variance than proteins without missing values. \n",
