    "[Triqler](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30482846/) is a novel software for protein quantification and differential protein identification. It uses probabilistic graphical models to generate posterior distributions for fold changes between treatment groups, highlighting uncertainty rather than hiding it. Conventional (frequentist) methods use filters and imputations to control error rate and often ignore certain error sources. This project aims to benchmark Triqler against MaxQuant (A commonly used tool for protein quantification). \n",

    "For this purpose, a data set with 10 samples containing mixtures of Arabidopsis Thaliana, Caenorhabditis Elegans and Homo Sapiens proteins are used. The concentration levels are known. Theoretically, the results from Triqler should be more representative of the de facto protein quantification, since no filters or imputations methods are used, but previous attempts at showing this fact ([here](https://patruong.github.io/bayesProtQuant/)) have shown that imputation methods could severely impact the results obtained by MaxQuant, making it look either much worse or much better by giving it an unfair advantage or disadvantage. One important aspect of this research is therefore how to make a fair comparison of Triqler and MaxQuant. Sub-tasks to answer relating to this aspect is \"How do we make a fair imputation if we need to impute values?\" and \"How do we visualize the comparison in a meaningful and comprehensible way?\"."
