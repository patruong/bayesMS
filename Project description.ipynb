    "[Triqler](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30482846/) is a novel software for protein quantification. It uses probabilistic graphical models to generate posterior distributions for fold changes between treatment groups, highlighting uncertainty rather than hiding it. Conventional (frequentist) methods use filters and imputations to control error rate and often ignore certain error sources. This project aims to benchmark Triqler against Spectronaut (A commonly used tool for protein quantification). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, a data set with 10 samples containing mixtures of Arabidopsis Thaliana, Caenorhabditis Elegans and Homo Sapiens proteins are used. The concentration levels are known. Theoretically, the results from Triqler should be more representative of the protein quantification, since no filters or imputations methods are used, but previous attempts at showing this fact ([here](https://patruong.github.io/bayesProtQuant/)) have shown that imputation methods could severely impact the results obtained by Spectronaut, making it look either much worse or much better by giving it an unfair advantage or disadvantage. One important aspect of this research is therefore how to make a fair comparison of Triqler and Spectronaut. Sub-tasks to answer relating to this aspect is \"How do we make a fair imputation if we need to impute values?\" and \"How do we visualize the comparison in a meaningful and comprehensible way?\".\n",

    "## Problem\n",
    "Triqler is a novel software that uses a Bayesian model for protein quantification. Previous efforts for DIA protein quantification has been focused on [read up on DIA and fill in from Navarro et al. 217, Kuharev et al. 2015 annd Gotti et al. 2020].\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of bayesian modeling for protein quantification has not yet been shown better than existing methods, but the fact that Triqler is handling errors in multiple steps in a more theoretical sound way than the most commonly used protein quantification pipelines gives indication that it is better. A benchmark of said Triqler is therefore needed to show its performance. \n",

    "### Protein quantification using mass spectrometry\n",
    "Label-free mass spectrometry (MS) is an increasingly important tool for researchers in life sciences ([Zhu et al. 2009](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2010/840518/)). In the last decade developments in MS methodologies has made it possible to use it for accurate protein quantification ([Ong et al. 2005](https://www.nature.com/articles/nchembio736)). Various softwares has been developed for processing raw MS data into quantified protein abundances ([Mueller et al. 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18173218/)). Each of which has a unique set of algorithms for different tasks of the MS data processing workflow. A systematic review of the various softwares has been conducted by [Välikangas et al. 2017](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/19/6/1344/3859191). \n",

    "### Protein inference and why it is problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protein inference is the process of obtaining a list of identified proteins from peptide measurements ([Huang et al. 2012](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/13/5/586/415393)). There are several factors that make obtaining a list of identified proteins challenging: (1) There are usually only a small number of peptides for each protein because top typically only the top scoring peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) are included into the set of peptide identifications, which causes problems in protein identification confidence ([Resing et al. 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15228325/)). (2) Peptides from the same protein are not equally likely to be identified in a standard proteomics experiments. I.e. there is a low signal-to-noise ratio ([Bihan et al. 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15595722/),[Kuster et al. 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15957003/),[Tang et al. 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16873510/)). (3) Many peptide sequences can be mapped to more than one protein in a database (they are so called degenerate or shared peptides) ([Nesvizhskii et al. 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14632076/), [Nesvizhskii et al. 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16009968/)). (4) There is a variety of methods to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) [Li et al. 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23176300/).     \n",
    "\n",
    "When conducting a shotgun proteomics experiment we are often interested to see the set of proteins that has been present in a sample before proteolytic digestion. The most common method to control for errors is to use tresholds for the FDR. As the measured entities, spectra, are measurements of the peptides rather than proteins it makes protein-level FDRs complicated ([The et al. 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pmic.201500431)). In [The et al. 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pmic.201500431) it is pointed out that there are two competing null hypotheses in current protein inference methods that are meaningful: 1) \"false discoveries are protein with incorrect best scoring peptide inference\" and 2) \"false discoveries are absent proteins\". These two null hypothesis are meaningful in the right context and can be accurately estimated. Besides these there are a very diverse set of possibilities to contruct the null hypothesis under. Which makes it very complicated to define what protein-level FDR means.     \n",

    "### Protein quantification for DIA.\n",
    "There are a lot of studies about data-dependent acquisition (DDA) protein quantification ([Välikangas et al. 2017](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/19/6/1344/3859191), [Mueller et al. 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18173218/)). However, in recent year the interest seems to have shifted towards data-independent acquisition (DIA) protein quantification. With in-depth evaluation studies such as [Navarro et al. 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5120688/), [Kuharev et al. 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25545627/) and [Gotti et al. 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.365585v1.full). \n",
    "\n",
    "The DDA select precursor ions based on abundances and suffers from stochastic and irreproducible precursor ion selection ([Liu et al. 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15253663/),[Li et al. 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19294629/), [Amodei et al. 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13361-018-2122-8)), under-sampling ([Michalski et al. 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21309581/)) and long instrument cycle times ([Li et al. 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19294629/)). While DIA fragment all precusor ions within a fixed window, regardless of intensity, and yields a comprehensive fragment of ion data. However, wide isolation windows produce highly chimeric spectra, which limits the sensitivity and accuracy of quantification and identification ([Armodei et al 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13361-018-2122-8)). Several DIA mass spectrometric strategies has been implemented to handle these problems (SWATH-MS ([Gillet et al. 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3433915/)), HDMSE ([Geromanos et al. 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22811061/)) and AIF ([Geiger et al. 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2953918/))). In addition to the mass spectrometric problems, computatonal methods (raw dara processing, protein database searching and statistical analysis of the quantitative data) critically impact the results of analysis. [Navarro et al. 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5120688/) developed a computational benchmarking framework for label-free quantitative proteomics, LFQbench, to analyze performances on five DIA approach; four peptide-centric query tools (OpenSWATH ([Röst et al. 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24727770/)), SWATH2.0 , Skyline ([MacLean et al. 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2844992/)), Spectronaut ([Bruderer et al. 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4424408/)), which use MS/MS libraries to extracts groups of signals that reliably represent a specific peptide with statistical methods to discern true from false matches ([Pak et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24006250/), [Röst et al. 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24727770/), [Reiter et al. 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21423193/)) and one data-centric approach (DIA-Umpire ([Tsou et al. 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4399776/))) which constructs pseudo tandem MS spectra that can be identified and quantified using conventional database searching and protein-inference tools. It has been shown that the overlap of peptide and protein identification provided by the four-library based tools are higher than what is typically achieved for MS/MS idenfications between different DDA search engine ([Bell et al. 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2785450/), [Shteynberg et al. 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3769318/), [Yuan et al. 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4184451/)).\n",

    "### Missing values and Bayesian missing data. \n",
    "Missing values are a frequent problem in life science studies. Incomplete data can cause substantial amount of bias and seriously compromise inferences from studies if they are not hendled appropriately ([Jakobsen et al. 2017](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-017-0442-1)). Besides the common missing value imputation methods (such as min, max, mean and median imputation. So called single imputation which cause bias ([Dziura et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24058309/))) various methods have been developed to tackle this problem, such as using imputation models ([Barnard et al. 1999](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/096228029900800103)) and multiple imputation methods ([Jørgensen et al. 2014](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111964)). The mechanism causing the data to be missing is another aspect that should be considered when handling missing values if possible ([Jakobsen et al. 2017](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-017-0442-1#ref-CR19)). Bayesian methods have been receiving much attention in the literature for handling missing values in various context, and with or without taking different mechnisms into account ([Ma et al. 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324510645_Bayesian_methods_for_dealing_with_missing_data_problems#pfe)). Using Bayesian models the missingness can be modelled using observed quantities by using known data to marginalize. Therefore, handling missing values with Bayesian models are very natural and comes without imputing, such as used in [The et al. 2018](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/357285v2). However, incorrectly specied missing values also does cause problems for Bayesian models ([Mason J. 2010](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/5498)) and corretly specifying missing models greatly improves the overall model fit ([Mason et al. 2010](http://eprints.ncrm.ac.uk/1691/1/InsightsSubmitted.pdf)). In [The et al. 2018](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/357285v2) a probability distribution is assined over the possible values of the missing value, and this distribution is marginalized over when inferrening protein's quantity. Resulting in a protein quantity which incorporates uncertainty into it, which is manifested by a larger variance than proteins without missing values. \n",
