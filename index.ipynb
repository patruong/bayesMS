    "# About\n",
    "\n",
    "[Triqler](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30482846/) is a novel software for protein quantification and differential protein identification. It uses probabilistic graphical models to generate posterior distributions for fold changes between treatment groups, highlighting uncertainty rather than hiding it. Conventional (frequentist) methods use filters and imputations to control error rate and often ignore certain error sources. This project aims to benchmark Triqler against MaxQuant (A commonly used tool for protein quantification). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, a data set with 10 samples containing mixtures of Arabidopsis Thaliana, Caenorhabditis Elegans and Homo Sapiens proteins are used. The concentration levels are known. Theoretically, the results from Triqler should be more representative of the de facto protein quantification, since no filters or imputations methods are used, but previous attempts at showing this fact ([here](https://patruong.github.io/bayesProtQuant/)) have shown that imputation methods could severely impact the results obtained by MaxQuant, making it look either much worse or much better by giving it an unfair advantage or disadvantage. One important aspect of this research is therefore how to make a fair comparison of Triqler and MaxQuant. Sub-tasks to answer relating to this aspect is \"How do we make a fair imputation if we need to impute values?\" and \"How do we visualize the comparison in a meaningful and comprehensible way?\".\n",

    "The files from the latest try are named PSSS3_triqler_input_renormalized.tsv (triqler input file) and PSSS3_triqler_output_proteins.<x>vs<y>.tsv\n",
    "\n",
    "The script I used for converting the spectronaut files (they have an xls extension, but they're actually just tab separated files): https://github.com/statisticalbiotechnology/mergespec/blob/master/bin/bayesquant/convert_spectronaut_to_triqler_input.py\n",
    "\n",
    "The version of triqler I used to generate the data is on a branch called large_scale_optimizations: https://github.com/statisticalbiotechnology/triqler/tree/large_scale_optimizations\n",
    "However, I'm not entirely sure if this is the same version that I used to generate the files, since I made some changes while working on this. So, if you run triqler yourself with this branch the results might be different. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some issues I had to generate a report comparing Triqler to Spectronaut were:\n",
    "1. we either have their original results (500-PSSS3-precursor_Report.xls), which has a column \"PG.Quantity\" that contain the protein concentrations, but has missing values as it has been filtered on some FDR. Alternatively, we have their results with decoys ('S500-PSSS3-equ decoy_Report.xls'), which is not filtered on FDR and does not contain missing values, but does not contain a column with the protein quantity and I don't really know how they summarized peptide quantities to protein quantities. The first option seems more reasonable, as this is what they would normally report.\n",
    "2. with these original results, we have to choose a missing value strategy and this will most likely give them either an unfair disadvantage (impute row average) or an unfair advantage (impute lowest observed value). Imputing the lowest observed value seems to be most in line with the DIA approach and I already created a file with protein concentrations using this strategy (500-PSSS3-precursor_Report.proteins.tsv) which could be useful. For the Triqler results, you can use any of the PSSS3_triqler_output_proteins.<x>vs<y>.tsv (the columns we'll use don't change for different <x> and <y>) and take the columns starting with \"S01:S01_R01\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Future steps:\n",
    "- Sort the proteins by pearson correlation(?) between the true concentrations and predicted concentrations and create graph with the correlation on the x-axis and the number of proteins on the y-axis. Note that the protein concentrations for spectronaut are not log2 transformed, whereas the Triqler protein concentrations are log2 transformed. Also, note that the Triqler results include proteins with high identification PEP, we thus might want to filter the list of proteins on e.g. 1% protein-identification FDR. This should all be relatively easy to do.\n",
    "- Check if the value of the lowest observed imputed value for the spectronaut data (currently 139.428100585938) matters, since it will most likely affect the pearson correlation, especially if we do a log2 transformation first.\n",
    "- Check the influence of the number of allowed missing values. The spectronaut data does not seem to include a limit for the number of missing values, while I think I allowed up to 25 (out of 50 samples) missing values per peptide for Triqler. It's a bit hard to compare though, since the missing values for spectronaut would only work on protein level, whereas the missing values for triqler are on peptide level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correction to mail:\n",
    "Small correction to the previous mail, I actually allowed up to 35 missing values for Triqler. The concentrations for the C Elegans were dropping off so fast that such a large number was necessary (https://github.com/statisticalbiotechnology/mergespec/blob/735ed743924fa705cb2c1f64509e5a1540add574/bin/bayesquant/calibration.py#L63).\n",

    "### Data-dependent Acquisition and Data Independent Acquisition (DIA).\n",
    "In data-dependent acquisition (DDA), a protein sample is digested into peptides, ionized and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Peptide signals that rise above a certain treshold (noise level) in a mass spectrum are selected for fragmentation, producing tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) that can be matched to spectra in a database. The mass spectrometer randomly samples peptides for fragmentation and is biased to pick those with strongest signal, which makes it problematic to reproducibly quantify low-abundance peptides (which could hold biological value).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data-independent acquisition is an approach to acquisition in Mass Spectrometry which fragments all peptides within a defined mass-to-charge (m/z) windows (as opposed to a select narrow window around \"the strongest signal\"). The analysis is repeated as the mass spectrometer marches up the full m/z range, which results in accurate peptide quantificaiton without being limited to profiling predefined peptied of interest.    \n",
    "\n",
    "A potential drawback of the DIA is the existence of multiple peptides in an m/z window. The fragmentation of multiple peptides results in chimeric (multiplexed) spectra which are more complex than single peptide spectra. Procedures for deconvoluting these spectra are required. Two methods for DIA are (OpenSWATH)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24727770/] and (ISOQUANT)[https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2767]. "

    "The reported protein expressions per run are the expected value of the protein's expression in that run. They represent relative values (not log transformed) to the protein's mean expression across all runs, which itself would correspond to the value 1.0. For example, a value of 1.5 means that the expression in this sample is 50% higher than the mean across all runs. A second example comparing values across samples: if sample1 has a value of 2.0 and sample2 a value of 1.5, it means that the expression in sample1 is 33% higher than in sample2 (2.0/1.5=1.33). We don't necessarily recommend using these values for downstream analysis, as the idea is that the actual value of interest is the fold change between treatment groups rather than between samples."
